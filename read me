This code aims to find out the minimum number of coins needed to make up a specific amount of money. You provide it with a list of coins and the target amount you want to reach. The coin_change method is the main function you call and it checks the amount you need which is zero. If its more than zero, then it figures out how to reach that using the fewest coins possible. If it finds a way, it tell you the minimum number of coins needed. otherwise it returns -1. Find is a function that tries different cominations of coints to see which combination give the minimum number of coins to make the target amount. It starts by trying to solve the problem using the first coin in the list and goes on trying with  different combination of coins. For each coing, it considers two scenarios, either it uses the coin or it skip and tries the next coin. It keeps track on the minimum number of coins needed for each amount and saves these numbers in a table in case it is needed to be used again. The process continues until it has tried all combinations.
